      <description>This project uses the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Model to predict the future evolution of the EUR/USD exchange rate. GBM is a stochastic process commonly used in financial modeling to simulate the random movement of assets such as stock prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. This project was developed in a real risk management scenario to assess the risk that a client had in his derivatives portfolio. Other analyses, such as VAR, were also performed.</description>
